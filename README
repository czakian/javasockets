This is a simple client-server socket that adds whatever number you input to the previous number stored in the Data class
The client then receives the updated Data class with the numbers added to it. 

This is meant as a demonstration of how to send objects through a socket. I used this to figure out how to send
objects for my racing game, but it might be helpful to someone else, so enjoy. :)

To run the code do the following in a terminal:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[czakian@cszakian javasockets]$ make
javac  DataServer.java
javac  DataClient.java
[czakian@cszakian javasockets]$ make server
java DataServer
server listening on port 5015
0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:5015
Waiting for connections.
^Z
[3]+  Stopped                 make server =======>>>do this using ctrl z
[czakian@cszakian javasockets]$ bg
[3]+ make server &
[czakian@cszakian javasockets]$ make client
java DataClient
accepted a connection from: /127.0.0.1
Waiting for connections.
10 <<=== this is the output after you input an integer into the joption pane that will pop up when you start the client
35
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, be sure to bring the server to the foreground and close it,
otherwise it will just sit there listening on port 5015.

Currently the socket is just listening on the local host on port 5015, and is hard coded. you can easily change this
to suit your own needs. Be sure to change both the client and the server side to reflect the port and ip changes.
